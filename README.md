About
--

This is a collection of some verilog code that Jim and I wrote while exploring some hardware design during our research project. 

Some of the more interesting designs
--
  1. `2N_sequence_adder`
  2. `parallel_sorter_N` and `parallel_sorter_4`
  3. `pascal triangle`
  4. `sequence_sorter` (working)

Documentations
--
Each of the project directory will have a README.md file which serves as the documentation for each design. 

Iverilog
--
Almost every project (except the interfaces) uses `iverilog` compiler and simulator. So, make sure it is installed.

GTKwave
--
Useful tool to debug code using waveform.
